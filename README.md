# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The playwright Louise has estimated that it will cost her around $10,000 to put on her first play, Fever. She would like to crowdfund the startu-up capital needed for the play using the web platform Kickstarter. Louise has asked our consulting firm to review Kickstarter data to identify whether there are significant factors that might influence the outcome of her Kickstarter campaign. Specifically, Louise wants to know when to launch her campaign, and what her target funding goal should be.
